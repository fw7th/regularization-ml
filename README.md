# Cutout v. Dropout
*‚ÄúExploring dropout regularization and cutout augmentation in CNNs on CIFAR-10.‚Äù*

---

## üîπ Overview
This project explores the impact of **dropout** and **cutout** on model generalization in a lightweight CNN trained on CIFAR-10.\

![Model Architecture](results/model_architecture.png)

We test:
- Dropout applied to the fully connected layers  
- Dropout applied to the convolutional layers  
- Cutout augmentation applied to the baseline CNN  

Both dropout and cutout improved accuracy by ~2‚Äì3% compared to baseline.\

## üîπ Results Summary
| Experiment           | Val Acc (%) | Test Acc (%) | Notes                     |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Baseline             | 82.4        |  81.8        | No dropout, standard aug  |
| Baseline + Cutout    | 84.0        |  84.0        | Cutout size = 8           |
| FC Dropout           | 83.7        |  83.8        | Dropout p=0.5             |
| Conv Dropout         | 85.0        |  83.3        | Dropout p=0.1             |

> Multiple dropout probabilities and cutout sizes were tested. Only the best settings are shown here.\
> For full details, see the respective notebooks in `notebooks/`.

**Takeaway:** Dropout in convolutional layers gave the highest validation accuracy, while cutout matched dropout in test accuracy.\
