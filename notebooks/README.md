### **03_conv_dropout.ipynb**  
- **Setup:** Dropout applied to convolutional layers.  
- **Result:** Val 85.0% / Test 83.3%  
- **Observation:** Strongest regularization effect; higher validation accuracy, slightly weaker test generalization.

### **04_cutout.ipynb**  
- **Setup:** Cutout augmentation applied to the baseline CNN.  
- **Result:** Val 84.0% / Test 84.0%  
- **Observation:** Cutout matched or exceeded dropout in test accuracy, highlighting augmentationâ€™s strength over architectural regularization.

- Baseline accuracy was surpassed by all regularization methods.  
- **Conv dropout** achieved the highest validation accuracy, while **cutout** gave the best test accuracy.  
- Each notebook includes result tables comparing against the baseline.  
- Multiple dropout probabilities and cutout sizes were tested; only the best-performing settings are reported here.
- **Comparison:** Dropout in convolutional layers gave the highest validation accuracy. Cutout matched dropout in test accuracy, showing its strength as a data augmentation technique.
